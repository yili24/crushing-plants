On average, the price ranges from R250 to R600 per tonne. However, it is important to note that glass containers have different values compared to other types of glass, such as windowpanes or windshields, due to their varying composition. While glass containers are the most commonly recycled glass, the price per tonne is generally higher compared to other types.</p><p>The demand for recycled glass in Durban is influenced by several factors. Firstly, the construction and architecture sectors play a significant role in driving the market demand for recycled glass.

This demand for recycled glass has a positive impact on the price per tonne in Durban.</p><p>Secondly, the beverage industry contributes to the demand for recycled glass. Many beverage companies in Durban have realized the environmental benefits of using recycled glass containers for their products.

Hence, the demand for recycled glass containers increases, affecting the price per tonne.</p><p>Furthermore, government policies and regulations also play a significant role in shaping the price per tonne of recycled glass in Durban. The South African government has been proactive in promoting recycling by implementing policies that support the recycling industry. Incentives and subsidies for recycling companies often encourage higher recycling rates, subsequently affecting the supply and demand dynamics of recycled glass.</p><p>It is also crucial to mention that the price per tonne of recycled glass can be influenced by global market trends, as recycled materials are part of the global supply chain. Changes in international market demands, tariffs, and transportation costs can impact the price of recycled glass in Durban.</p><p>Overall, the price of recycled glass per tonne in Durban reflects the growing recognition of the benefits of recycling and the increasing demand for sustainable materials. As the recycling industry continues to evolve and gain momentum in Durban, the price per tonne of recycled glass is likely to fluctuate.
